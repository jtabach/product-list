Product-List allows the user to add items to their shopping cart with custom Names, Descriptions, Prices, and Images. Once added, items will show up in table format. Each item can be deleted from the table. The user may chose to edit the item, where they will be redirected to a new page consisting of the items details and a new edit form.

#### Sorting

The user can sort their items by clicking on the appropriate table header. When the table header is clicked a second time, the items will sort in reverse order.

#### Searching

The user may search for a specific or multiple items in their cart. By typing in the search box the user may search by Product, Description, or Price.

#### Updating Total Price

The total price of items in the shopping cart will be automatically updated every time an item is deleted or edited. While the user is searching, the total price will reflect only the items shown during search.
